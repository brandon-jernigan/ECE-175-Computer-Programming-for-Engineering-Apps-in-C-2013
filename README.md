# ECE-175-Computer-Programming-for-Engineering-Apps-in-C-2013
ECE 175 introduces undergraduate students to the fundamental principles of programming for solving engineering programs, using the C programming language. It familiarizes students with the process of computational thinking and the translation of real-life engineering problems to computation problems. Further, it describes the basic techniques for systematic software design. It provides fundamental knowledge in basic programming concepts such as program flow control, memory management, and elementary data structures.
